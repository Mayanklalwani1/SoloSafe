**SoloSafe: Women security + support** is a responsive website to help women through panic and unsafe situations.<br>
A main feature of website is the <u>**Emergency Button**</u>.<br> If the person feels unsafe in any situtation, they can click on that emergency button and within no time an <u>**Alert Message**</u> will be sent to her <u>**Trusted Contacts**</u> with her <u>**Location Credentials**</u> that she is in need of help. 

_Our main aim is to help women with the support of latest technologies._
